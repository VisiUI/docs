title: Welcome to VisiUI
---

**VisiUI** is a powerful **React component library** designed to provide developers with pre-built, highly customizable UI components that can be easily integrated into any application. These components are designed with flexibility and ease of use in mind, making it simple to enhance the visual appeal and functionality of your app without extensive development work.

You can **copy and paste** the code for each component directly from the documentation into your project. This makes it easy to start using VisiUI components right away, while the npm packages are being developed for future releases.

## Why VisiUI?

Here are a few reasons why developers are choosing VisiUI:

- **Pre-built Components**: VisiUI offers a rich collection of components that can be easily integrated into your React application.
- **Editable and Customizable**: All components can be edited to fit your specific use case, ensuring flexibility and adaptability.
- **Copy-Paste Simplicity**: No need to install anything yetâ€”simply browse through the docs, copy the code you need, and paste it into your project.
- **Future-proof**: While you can copy-paste components now, VisiUI is actively being developed, and future releases will include npm packages for smoother integration.
  
## How to Use VisiUI Components

For now, using VisiUI is as simple as finding the component you need in the documentation, copying the code, and pasting it directly into your React project.

The code:
```jsx
import React from 'react';

export const Button = ({ onClick, children }) => {
  return (
    <button
      style={{
        padding: '10px 20px',
        backgroundColor: '#007bff',
        color: '#fff',
        border: 'none',
        borderRadius: '4px',
      }}
      onClick={onClick}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};

```

How you can use it:

```jsx
import { Button } from './path-to-your-components/Button';

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, VisiUI!</h1>
      <Button onClick={() => alert('You clicked me!')}>Click Me</Button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```
